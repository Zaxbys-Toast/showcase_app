## Problem Sources and Attribution

The programming challenges solved in this repository are inspired by and based on
problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

Project Euler problems are used here strictly as references for problem ideas.
All problem descriptions, numbering, and original concepts are the intellectual
property of Project Euler. In accordance with Project Euler’s guidelines, full
problem statements are not reproduced in this repository.
The purpose of this repository is to showcase my problem-solving approach,
algorithm design, and implementation skills.
